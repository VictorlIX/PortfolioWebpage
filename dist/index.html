          <ul>
            Created a python program that utilizes the Azure DevOps API. The program goes through the whole teams work items and singles out only work items that contain certain meeting code words. It will then close out any meetings that are older than 5 days. This program is put in Azure function and with a timer trigger it is set to run weekly. This helped the cloud transformation team keep their azure devops work items clean and free of any old items.
