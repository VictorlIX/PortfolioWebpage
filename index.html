        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

        <p>
           <b>Resume Website</b>
           <ul>
            Created this website utilizing Javascript, ThreeJS, CSS, and HTML           </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Azure DevOps Meeting Ender</b>
          <ul>
            Created a python program that utilizes Azure DevOps API. The program goes through the team‚Äôs work items  and singles out work items that contain certain code words pertaining to meetings. It will then close out any meetings that are older than 5 days. This program is put in Azure function and, with a timer trigger, it is set to run weekly. This helped the cloud transformation team keep their Azure DevOps work items clean and free of any old items.           </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>DevOps Work Items of Age Reminder</b>
          <ul>
            Created a python program that utilizes Azure API and Gmail API. This program analyzes each team member‚Äôs work items. If the program notices that a work item has been left untouched for 30 days, it will create an email script and send an email to the corresponding team member. This email reminds them to update/close the work item. This program is placed in Azure function and a timer trigger is set for the program to run daily at 8 AM.           </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Azure Query Migration:</b>
          <ul>
            Created a PowerShell script that was used to help a company transition from one Azure DevOps Organization to another, specifically the migration of queries. Essentially, this program goes through one organization‚Äôs queries and pastes them into the new organization. 
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
         <b>Sales Cloud Projects</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Created reference architecture diagrams and price estimates. The diagrams were created to help companies easily see the differences between Azure and AWS, including basic pricing differences. This was done for both Windows and Linux versions. These diagrams were utilized by the sales team to show to potential customers. The price estimates were created for companies planning to migrate to the cloud, these price estimates were done in both AWS and Azure. </li>
            
          </ul>
